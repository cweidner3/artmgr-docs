Application Preview
===================

This application is composed of a series of tabs that each when navigated to
will display a table representing the list of entries associated with the
underlying database table.

Each row may be double clicked to naviate to a view that displays more
information on that entry as well as allows editing of the entry.
By default data is saved when navigating away from any particular page either
via the "Back" button or using the page controls.
